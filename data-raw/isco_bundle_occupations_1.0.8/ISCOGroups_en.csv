ISCOGroup,http://data.europa.eu/esco/isco/C0,0,Armed forces occupations,,"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/occupations,
http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/isco","Armed forces occupations include all jobs held by members of the armed forces.  Members of the armed forces are those personnel who are currently serving in the armed forces, including auxiliary services, whether on a voluntary or compulsory basis, and who are not free to accept civilian employment and are subject to military discipline. Included are regular members of the army, navy, air force and other military services, as well as conscripts enrolled for military training or other service for a specified period.
Occupations in this major group are classified into the following sub-major groups:
01  Commissioned Armed Forces Officers
02  Non-commissioned Armed Forces Officers
03  Armed Forces Occupations, Other Ranks
Excluded from this group are: 
 -  jobs held by persons in civilian employment of government establishments concerned with defence issues;
 -  police (other than military police);
 -  customs inspectors and members of border or other armed civilian services.
Notes
Many jobs performed by members of the armed forces are similar, in terms of the nature of the work performed, to civilian occupations such as medical doctors, radio operators, cooks, secretaries and heavy truck drivers.  Conceptually, it may be appropriate, therefore, to classify such jobs in the armed forces with similar civilian jobs.  This approach is adopted in several national occupation classifications.  Typically such classifications also identify a number of military-specific occupational groups.  In many countries, however, it is not possible to produce information about the nature of the work performed by members of the armed forces.  In adapting ISCO-08 for national purposes countries may wish, therefore, to consider what approach best suits their circumstances and user needs.  For purposes of international comparability, however, where data pertaining to members of the armed forces are reported and classified by occupation, they should be included, where possible, in ISCO-08 Major Group 0: Armed Forces Occupations.

Tasks performed by managers usually include: formulating and advising on the policy, budgets, laws and regulations of enterprises, governments and other organizational units; establishing objectives and standards and formulating and evaluating programmes and policies and procedures for their implementation; ensuring appropriate systems and procedures are developed and implemented to provide budgetary control; authorizing material, human and financial resources to implement policies and programmes; monitoring and evaluating performance of the organization or enterprise and of its staff; selecting or approving the selection of  staff;  ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements; planning and directing daily operations; representing and negotiating on behalf of the government, enterprise or organizational unit managed in meetings and other forums.
Occupations in this major group are classified into the following sub-major groups:
11 Chief Executives, Senior Officials and Legislators
12 Administrative and Commercial Managers
13 Production and Specialized Services Managers
14 Hospitality, Retail and Other Services Managers
Notes
In distinguishing between managers classified in Major Group 1: Managers, and supervisors, classified in other major groups, it should be noted that both managers and supervisors may plan, organize, coordinate, control and direct the work done by others.  In addition, managers usually have responsibility for and make decisions about: the overall strategic and operational direction of a business or organizational unit (for example about the kinds, quantity and quality of goods to be produced); budgets (how much money is to be spent and for what purposes); and the selection, appointment and dismissal of staff.  Supervisors may provide advice and assistance to managers on these matters, especially in relation to staff selection and dismissal, but do not have authority to make decisions.
It should be noted that it is not a necessary condition that managers have responsibility for all three of strategic and operational direction, budgets and staff selection and dismissal. The degree of autonomy they exercise may also vary. The critical difference is that supervisors are responsible only for the supervision of the activities of other workers, whereas managers have overall responsibility for the operations of an organizational unit.

Tasks performed usually include: overseeing, supervising and coordinating the activities of tradespersons, process control technicians, machine operators, assemblers,  labourers and other workers;  organizing and planning daily work;  preparing cost estimates, records and reports; identifying shortages of staff or supplies; ensuring safety of workers; instructing and training new staff.
Occupations in this minor group are classified into the following unit groups:
3121 Mining Supervisors
3122 Manufacturing Supervisors
3123 Construction Supervisors
Notes
Jobs classified in Minor Group 312:  Mining, Manufacturing and Construction Supervisors mainly involve planning, organizing, coordinating, controlling and directing the work done by others.  Most of the time workers employed in these jobs do not perform the tasks performed by those they supervise, although they frequently have extensive experience in performance of these tasks.  Those who carry out the tasks and duties of the jobs they supervise, in addition to controlling the technical quality of the work done by others, should be classified with the workers they supervise. These supervisory jobs often are called “foremen/women” or “team leaders”. 
In distinguishing between managers classified in Major Group 1: Managers, and supervisors, classified in other major groups, it should be noted that both managers and supervisors may plan, organize, coordinate, control and direct the work done by others.  In addition, managers usually have responsibility for and make decisions about: the overall strategic and operational direction of a business or organizational unit (for example about the kinds, quantity and quality of goods to be produced); budgets (how much money is to be spent and for what purposes); and the selection, appointment and dismissal of staff.  Supervisors may provide advice and assistance to managers on these matters, especially in relation to staff selection and dismissal, but do not have authority to make decisions.
It should be noted that it is not a necessary condition that managers have responsibility for all three of strategic and operational direction, budgets and staff selection and dismissal. The degree of autonomy they exercise may also vary. The critical difference is that supervisors are responsible only for the supervision of the activities of other workers, whereas managers have overall responsibility for the operations of an organizational unit.

Notes
In some jobs, the work of process control technicians may be combined with supervision of staff in other occupations, such as plant and machine operators and assemblers.  These jobs should be classified in Minor Group 313: Process Control Technicians, unless supervision of other workers is the clearly predominant element of the work and the process control activities are relatively simple.  For example, a chemical processing plant controller who operates and monitors chemical processing units and equipment from a central control room, and also supervises the activities of chemical products plant and machine operators, should be classified in Unit Group 3133: Chemical Processing Plant Controllers.
